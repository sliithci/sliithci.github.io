          Making the transition with confidence, SLIIT had delivered lectures to students via the institution’s advanced online platform. So, the new semester has started. So, the HCI module also started with online delivering and as well as physical delivering. Online lecturing going on to 75% students and with the start of the physical lecturing at SLIIT 25% of students come to SLIIT to learn their module according to a proper time table. As online, we upload recorded lectures and doing webinars to solve questions of the students and also continuing lab sessions and tute as well. Giving a lab sheet with an instruction video and discuss the tute in the webinars and as usual, we continue the labs, tute and lectures to the 25% students who are coming to SLLIT. We hope soon we can get 100% to SLIIT by getting over from this COVID-19 pandemic and do the HCI module with interacting with each other with creativity as groups.

          HCI Group started and continuing successfully with online meetings using MS Teams because of COVID – 19. We had bi-weekly meetings and now we have strong HCI group with 34 members. As HCI group we have recognized our strengths and weaknesses and help each other by our strength to cover up our weaknesses. HCI group have started 3 MPhils with the help of our senior members and continuing some research projects. From every meeting, we have a short talk or about a research talk. So, it’s a great experience for new researchers. And through these meetings, they will definitely motivate and they can get help and advice from the senior members to do good research. In future, we are going to attend physically to the meetings at SLIIT premises.

          As HCI group we have started to provide consultancy services in terms of usability, UI/UX, and related aspects for both internal and external projects. From the idea of Mr Jagath, we already completed our first consultancy with the help of Dr Shyam and Mr Jagath. It’s an internal website ICAC. We got good feedback about our consultancy and got new consultancy services like Logo and website design for CSSAT, Trello board for CSSAT, Codefest website…..etc. So, we are hoping to engage all the members to do these consultancy services according to their abilities and preferences with the senior members.
